```python
# A simple generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n

# Using for loop
for item in my_gen():
    print(item) 
```
```
This is printed first

This is printed second

This is printed at last
